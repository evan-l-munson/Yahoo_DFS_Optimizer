Description: This tool will allow the user to build optimal NBA line-ups for
  Yahoo Daily Fantasy contests. This tool will import data (scrape) from 
  RotoWire's site and then generate five top line-ups using the site's predictions. 
  This capability will save the user subscription money as many, if not all, 
  DFS sites charge for these insights.

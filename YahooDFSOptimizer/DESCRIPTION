Description: This tool will allow the user to build optimal NBA line-ups for Yahooâ€™s Daily Fantasy contests. This tool will import data (scrape) from RotoWire's site and then generate five top line-ups using the site's predictions. This capability will save the user subscription money as many, if not all, DFS sites charge for these insights.
